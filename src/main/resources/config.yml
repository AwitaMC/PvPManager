# PvPManager Configuration File
# -> In Combat: Tag players on PvP and what should happen when they are in combat
# -> Punishments: Set if you want to punish or not a player that logs out while in combat.
# -> Toggle Signs: You can do the same as the command "/pvp" does but by clicking signs. 
# Just write [pvpmanager] on the first line of a sign, make sure you have the permissions to create one.
# -> Newbie Protection: New players on your server will be protected from PvP for the time you define.
# -> PvPTimer: Toggle PvP automatically on the times specified for each world.
# -> World Exclusions: Write the name of worlds where you don't want to use PvPManager. 
# Just delete the examples and write the name of your worlds to disable.
